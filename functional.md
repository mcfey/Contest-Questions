My program is Tic Tac Toe. It is shared through runpython.com. The program starts by prompting the user whether they would like to be Xs or Os. Once the user responds with one or the other, they are taken to a graphics screen in a new window showing an empty tic tac toe grid. The user can click in the grid and one of their shapes will appear in the box that they click in. After the user makes their move the computer prints one of their shapes in a different position on the board and the user can make another move. This continues until the board is full. The computer should make moves so that the game will always end either in the computer winning or a draw.
